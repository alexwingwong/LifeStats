# LifeStats

This is Alex Wong's 2022 summer React Native project.
Its still a work in progress but its my first React project and I've spent a few hours on it. 

This app allows the user to select a date and record a mood for that day, allowing for data analysis to be preformed.
Currently it is setup for recording moods, but I want to template the page, so users can create their own habits.
Personally I want to track my moods, fitness, and sleep. I like being able to see all the data in a calendar form,
and it would be cool feature to cross analyze all the data together and see how these habits affect each other.
